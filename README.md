# Fragment - Collaborative Code IDE

![Sample App Image](./demo.png)

## What is Fragment?
This was built to allow me to code with friends. It uses socket.io to allow us to edit the same script in realtime. This way my friends can watch me code while practicing social distancing :), all jokes aside i hope you add fragment as a widget to your website if you frequently code for friends.
